 Tectonic maps for data analysis applications in solid Earth science

2021 June 09
The global_tectonics package is a set of shapefiles that can be used for analysis of Earth science data.  It consists of four separate shapefiles:
  plates.shp - polygons of tectonic plates and crust types
  plate_boundaries.shp - lines of plate boundary types
  oc_boundaries.shp - lines demarcating the ocean-continent boundary
  global_gprv.shp - polygons of global geologic provinces

Details about the construction of the models is discussed in Hasterok, D., Halpin, J., Hand, M., Collins, A., Kreemer, C., Glorie, S., (submitted) A new global geologic provinces map and an updated plate map. Earth Science Reviews.

The model is intended to be updated as new knowledge is gained about the locations and processes affecting provinces.  To do so requires community effort.  The global_tectonics GitHub repository can facilitate these updates.
