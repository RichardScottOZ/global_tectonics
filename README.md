 Tectonic maps for data analysis applications in solid Earth science

2021 July 07
The global_tectonics package is a set of shapefiles that can be used for analysis of Earth science data.  There are several models as part of the package, which includes a present-day plate model and a geologic province model.  The models include metadata that permit the creation of several related (and seamless) maps including the lithospheric type (oceanic/continental), last orogenic event, and oceanic domains.  It consists of four separate shapefiles:
  
  plates.shp - polygons of tectonic plates and crust types
  
  boundaries.shp - lines of plate boundary types
  
  oc_boundaries.shp - lines demarcating the ocean-continent boundary
  
  global_gprv.shp - polygons of global geologic provinces

Details about the construction of the models is discussed in Hasterok et al. (in prep., Earth Sci. Rev.).  The paper describes the definitions for terms used in the assignment of metadata.

QGIS style files are also provided for displaying the shapefiles as presented in the original paper.

The model is intended to be updated as new knowledge is gained about the locations and processes affecting provinces.  To do so requires community effort.  The global_tectonics GitHub repository can facilitate these updates.
