# global_tectonics
 Tectonic maps for data analysis applications in solid Earth science

2021 July 19
The global_tectonics package is a set of shapefiles that can be used for analysis of Earth science data.  For each shapefile, there is an associated *.gmt file in Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) vector format.  There are several models as part of the package, which includes a present-day plate model and a geologic province model.  The models include metadata that permit the creation of several related (and seamless) maps including the lithospheric type (oceanic/continental), last orogenic event, and oceanic domains.  It consists of four separate shapefiles:

  plates.shp - polygons of tectonic plates and crust types

  boundaries.shp - lines of plate boundary types

  oc_boundaries.shp - lines demarcating the ocean-continent boundary

  global_gprv.shp - polygons of global geologic provinces

Details about the construction of the models is discussed in Hasterok, D., Halpin, J., Hand, M., Collins, A., Kreemer, C., Glorie, S., (submitted) New maps of global geologic provinces and tectonic plates, Earth Science Reviews.

A static version with additional global geophysical and tectonic datasets can be found with a QGIS project file on Zenodo data repository.

The model is intended to be updated as new knowledge is gained about the locations and processes affecting provinces.  To do so requires community effort.  The global_tectonics GitHub repository can facilitate these updates.
